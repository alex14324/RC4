# RC4 Malware Development

Welcome to the RC4 Malware Development repository. This project provides educational resources and examples related to the use of RC4 encryption in malware development. RC4 is a stream cipher known for its simplicity and speed, and it is used in malware to obfuscate and protect malicious payloads.

## Overview

RC4 (Rivest Cipher 4) is a stream cipher that encrypts data by generating a pseudo-random stream of bytes and XORing it with the plaintext. In malware development, RC4 is often used to:

- **Encrypt Payloads**: Obscure the malicious payload to evade detection by security tools.
- **Enhance Obfuscation**: Make analysis more difficult by encrypting the payload until runtime.

This repository offers insights into how RC4 can be implemented in malware and includes examples of RC4-based encryption and decryption.
